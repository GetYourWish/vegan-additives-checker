## 📊 How It Works

### Red (Definitely Not Vegan)
Animal-derived additives like gelatin (E441), beeswax (E901), carmine (E120), and dairy products.

### Orange (Sneaky Names)
Hidden animal ingredients like casein, whey, isinglass, and castoreum that aren't immediately obvious.

### Blue (Grey Area)
Ambiguous ingredients (E471, E627, natural flavors) that can be either plant-based or animal-derived. Requires verification.

### Yellow (Trace Warning)
Products with "may contain" warnings for cross-contamination. Safe for vegans (no animal exploitation), unsafe for allergies.

### Green (No Animal Ingredients Detected)
No flagged ingredients found. Verify with the original label as a final step.
